# Horiseon-Accessibility
Accessibility codebase for Horiseon

### Description

My motivation is to gain more experience while working on this project. I can use this knowledge to go towards my future portfolio. 

-I have amended the codebase to ensure that it follows accessibility standards and that it is optimized for search engines.

-I built this project to ensure that users with all abilities have the full experience while accessing the website. I wanted to ensure that this site is as easy to use as possible. 

-I fixed a broken link in the navigation bar. This allowed users to jump to the section of the page they are interested in. 

-I fixed the header to the page but I noticed that this affects the view of the selected section when using the navigation links, so i removed this after.

-I tested all atl attributes by using a screen reader.

This project solved many issues and allowed users to jump to the section they are looking for. The changes I made that affect the SEO will allow users to find the site easier from search engines. 

I learnt that code becomes clearer when using semantic elements and that you can group CSS classes to make the code easier to read.
